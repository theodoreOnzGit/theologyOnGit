= Introduction

Had a conversation with a facebook friend who came onto my post. 
I'm writing this down here, because there are some legitimate issues 
that need to be addressed. However, it shouldn't be on facebook.

The post I posted read like so 
"Many people reject Jesus because of bad experiences with 
religious people. 

But. Here's the thing... Jesus had bad experiences with religious 
people, too.

In fact, they killed him. People will let you down. Jesus won't."

Recording of comments was done as of 09 august 2023

= Comment 1

"My deconversion from Christianity was complex and 
complicated and isn’t just because 
of bad experiences with religious people or groups. Reading 
the Bible for myself helped me question it and 
my faith and see why some people have problems with believing it. 
I can’t believe that it’s the inspired word of God anymore. There are 
other reasons too. Jesus had some bad views and teachings besides good 
ones, and he was just a man. There’s also no 
evidence for Christianity being the one true religion or for its 
extraordinary claims like the resurrection.
If Christianity were true, why so many divisions over 
interpretation and theology? "

Right I wasn't quite prepared for this. But there are a few important 
issues brought up here.

1. Personal bad experiences with religious people and groups 
2. Other reasons for not believing the bible is the word of God (vague)
3. Jesus has bad views and teachings besides good ones (need clarity)
4. Jesus was just a man (claim, need clarity)
5. No evidence for Christianity being the one true religion (clarity?)
6. miraculous extraordinary claims have no backing

And now the question, "why so many divisions?" ie denominations

Obviously each matter has many different aspects. How much time can I 
spare?

One thing is obvious to me though, having experienced a physical healing 
miracle first hand in real-time, I don't think the miraculous is as 
out-of-reach for people any more. This part is perhaps the easiest.

I thought and prayed at least about the last part, and had a response 
ready. However, I wasn't sure how well received it was going to be.
I wasn't generally interested in debates. 

== My response

" Ah, hi... wasn't quite expecting this
Well, I've glanced upon some of what you've written before, and as far 
as I hear, you've been through a lot. It's fair 
to say there are many layers to your question 
besides the obvious.
So let me ask you first, what are you looking for 
by asking this question? Are you out for information and 
perspectives? Are you seeking to persuade me and other people 
about your beliefs? Or do you just want to be heard? Is it a 
combination of these or something I haven't quite listed?
If you let me know, then it will help 
me formulate a response (if you want to be responded to)
"

= Comment 2 

"It’s to show why I’m no longer a Christian and to help 
Christians to think for themselves about their beliefs and 
about why some people leave the religion. It’s also to help 
non-Christians see why some people don’t accept the Christian religion."

Okay sure, so it seems any intellectual response I give is not going to be 
well received. This means long periods of debate and arguing. I scarcely
have time for that. Also, no point spending effort to give answers if 
someone doesn't want to listen to them.

Well, I chose to respond. 
To an extent, it feels a little bit rude to me, that one would come up 
commenting to me to teach me how to think. 

== My Response 

" okay, first observation: it seems you are more interested 
in heard more than you are in hearing people out. In that case 
i will not answer the question you asked.

Second observation: you said you want to help people think for 
themselves. When you say you want to help people think 
for themselves, it is as if you posture yourself as the superior 
person teaching someone intellectually inferior how to think. And it 
sounds to me as if you are going around attempting to proselytise 
people with your comments. It is this very kind 
of behaviour that many non christians find irritating when christians do 
it, carrying a “holier than thou” attitude, I am aware that 
this is why many leave the church. And yet here you are making 
comments on my post and being pushy with your belief systems. Remind 
me if i have forgotten, have I personally done this to you? Did 
I shove my belief systems into your face the way you have just done 
by commenting in this manner as you have on my post? What wrong 
have I done to you that I need to rectify? "

= Comment 3 

== Part A: I responded to this bit (1207 hrs 24 July)
"
I see. You kinda sound arrogant here. The reason why I wanted people 
to think about why they believe is because some Christians proselytized 
to me when I left Christianity and I felt overwhelmed when 
they talked to me in person. Some didn’t let me 
speak about why I don’t believe anymore. I’m not proselytizing to 
people, but trying to educate them. Most Christians and other 
religious people can’t think for themselves when they encounter other 
religious beliefs or even non-religious beliefs and ideas. I’m not 
the one who’s pushy about my lack of beliefs or shoving them 
down other people’s throats like many Christians and followers 
of other missionary religions like Islam are when they encounter formerly 
religious people or those who never believed in 
their respective religions. Also, Christians and Muslims have 
a lot a privileges wherever they’re the majority. Christian privilege 
is huge in the US, and yet they cry out “persecution” when 
they face boundaries being set on them or their ability to 
persecute and discriminate against others is being eroded. You didn’t 
try to pressure me into believing again, but 
some other Christians did. Unfortunately, you misunderstood 
me, like many other Christians have when I told 
my reasons why I left Christianity.

Ask yourself: Why do so many former Christians experience manipulation 
or shunning from Christian peers, or even 
discrimination? Why is it that conservative Christians and 
Christian fundamentalists want to force LGBTQ people into suicide 
or back into the closet? Why do they want to force women and girls 
to be submissive to men and boys?

Most Christians and other religious people are indoctrinated during 
childhood and adolescence into their religions and can’t think 
critically when they encounter other beliefs or lack of beliefs. 
I was like that myself when I was a believer in Jesus.
The post itself misunderstands why people leave Christianity 
and doesn’t acknowledge that the Bible is full of inaccuracies, 
contradictions, and other inconsistencies. "


== Part B: He added this later at 24 July at 13:55, I didn't see nor respond
" Plus it doesn’t acknowledge 
that Christianity has the sources of religious trauma 
for many former Christians and those deconstructing or 
deconverting from Christianity.

The fact that you don’t want to hear my perspective shows 
me that you’re not different from other Christians like the 
cult members who I spoke to in 2020 through Zoom and text. 
Many religious people won’t listen to formerly religious people or 
non-religious people when they proselytize to them but the 
ones that they proselytize to are telling them why they don’t believe.
I don’t see myself as superior to others. "

== My Response 

" Look man, if you want to believe what you want to, I have 
no intent to change your mind. I am totally okay if you want 
to express yourself. My issue is not with that. You are totally free 
to express your thoughts on your own facebook page. And you 
are by all means free not to believe in Christianity.

Here's where my issue is, you say that other Christians 
overwhelm you when the proselytise you. I get it, and 
I don't support them overwhelming you. You didn't invite 
them to come and overwhelm you, and yet they did. But you have come 
to my page where I didn't invite you either, and you started overwhelming 
me with questions, each requires its own nuanced and detailed discussion 
that you could write several books on them. And 
you have done so more with your last post, and 
packaged US politics into the discussion, which I have 
no interest in doing talking about. The United States 
is not my country of origin and I do not have 
the time nor desire to delve into its political intricacies 
as of this time. In the culture I come from, 
it's considered pushy if you come up all of a sudden 
uninvited and ask someone to justify their views religion and 
politics. How do you not expect me to perceive you as 
pushy and disrespectful even though you are not 
as pushy like some other missionaries?

Look, I want you to have your own views, and I want you 
to think for yourself, same as you do. Facebook is 
a bad place to discuss these sensitive topics and it is easy to 
misunderstand each other. As much as I have misunderstood you, I will 
also say you misunderstand me. You want not 
to be overwhelmed, so do I. And as it is, you 
are overwhelming me. You're coming up wanting to share 
your experiences and learning journey, and you are expecting me 
to understand you from facebook text of all things. I have 
experiences and a journey of my own, and yet you made 
no attempt to understand my experiences or journey, and then you expect 
me to understand yours when you come knocking the 
door all of a sudden. Moreover your comments come across as 
"i know better than you" even though you may not consciously mean it like 
that. I am not inclined to answer questions 
posed in such a manner. In the same manner, I don't expect you to 
answer me and try to be understanding toward me if I were to 
do the same to you, overwhelming you with 
questions out of the blue. And that's why, 
as you said, I made no attempt to pressure you, and I 
have no desire to overwhelm you either. I wish 
you peace and want to call it quits. Be well. "

== Issues here

If one were to filter out the vitriol, here are the important points

1. Most religious people can't think for themselves, indoctrination
2. Stifled discussion when he wanted to bring up his views
3. Majority Religious Privilege 
4. Experiences of manipulation
5. LGBTQ issues, forced into suicide or back into the closet
6. forcing women and girls to be submissive to men and boys 
7. bible is full of inaccuracies, contradictions and inconsistencies

Now again, this is about six additional issues within the span of 
twelve posts. It's not really giving me any chance to answer. 
Can answer those later.

= Comment 4

"Ok. Sorry that we misunderstood each other. I wasn’t fully honest with 
myself when I began to show reasons why I left Christianity 
twice. I would have been open to hearing you tell me 
why you believe. What I mentioned that’s political isn’t limited to 
the US, but is also happening in some Latin American countries 
and in the Philippines, and even in Uganda and in some Eastern 
European countries.

You did comment on one of my posts without me inviting you to comment 
on my posts about Bible inconsistencies. But at that time, I 
didn’t make a post that everyone can see about all the 
reasons why I’m an agnostic atheist.
I don’t know how well atheists and other nonreligious people are 
treated in Singapore, especially if they used to be 
Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, etc.
My religious traumas were triggered when I responded to your post. The 
picture that you shared was what triggered my religious traumas. In 
some parts of the US, atheists and other nonreligious people are 
still discriminated.
I hope that in the future we can understand each other, especially about 
why you believe and why I don’t believe, even though we don’t 
convert, revert, or deconvert. I don’t want to pressure any religious 
person to deconvert from their religious beliefs."

== My Response

"Hey man, no hard feelings, and if I triggered your trauma in 
this present post. I am sorry this that happened and re-triggered 
your trauma. I did not intend to and I wasn't even intending the 
post for you.
Also fair statement on me commenting on your post previously. Apologies 
if that incident triggered your trauma as well. I'll try not to 
comment unless you want me to in future.

If it helps you, and I mean no malice, feel free to block any of 
my posts that may trigger your trauma. I don't want you 
to relive your negative experiences and I do wish you well. I 
do hope you can recover and become free of your religious trauma.

I appreciate your last statement and I don't want to 
pressure you as well. I hope there are no enmities now. Also, I 
have much on my hands at the moment with regards to finishing my 
studies, so I cannot really comment too much about these heavy topics.

Do take care. See you when I see you."

== Issues brought up 

J. Alvarez mentioned that 
I commented on his post uninvited when he talked about
biblical inconsistencies. Now, I looked up the post,
the original post on 11 July 2022:

" Incoherencias bíblicas No. 1: Contradicciones acerca de 
la salvación, la justificación, la obediencia, observación de la 
ley judía, las obras y la fe (hay más pasajes en el Nuevo 
Testamento sobre estos temas, los cuales se contradicen uno a otro y 
los siguientes pasajes cuando se relacionen con la salvación y la 
justificación). Sólo están listados los libros 
y capítulos con los pasajes resumados -

Gálatas 2 - Justificación por la fe aparte de las obras de la Ley
Efesios 2 - Salvados por gracia por medio de la fe en 
Cristo, y no por las obras
Gálatas 4 - Volviendo a la Ley resulta en 
la esclavitud a la Ley
Gálatas 5 - Sirviéndose y amándose entre ellos mismos y evitando 
“obras de la carne” (implicando obras y obediencia)
Efesios 4 hasta 6 - Obediencia y obras

Romanos 2 - Justificados por las obras

pueden salvarse antes de la muerte"

Translation:

"
Biblical inconsistencies #1: Contradictions about salvation, 
justification, obedience, observation of Jewish law, works and 
faith (there are more passages in the New Testament 
about these topics, which contradict each other and the following 
passages when they relate to salvation and the justification). Only 
the books and chapters with the passages summarized are listed -

Galatians 2 - Justification by faith apart from the works of the law
Ephesians 2 - Saved by grace through faith in Christ, and not by works
Galatians 4 - Returning to the law results in slavery to the law
Galatians 5 - Serving and loving one another and avoiding 
“works of the flesh” (involving works and obedience)
Ephesians 4:6 - Obedience and works
Hebrews 11 - Blind faith that results in works and obedience
Philippians 2 - Working toward the work of salvation with fear 
and fear, without questioning anything or complaining
Philippians 3 - Avoiding Legalism
John 14 - keeping the commandments of Jesus
Romans 10 - Calling on the name of the Lord results in salvation
Matthew 7 - Only those who do the will of God will be 
saved and many who say ‘Lord.. ‘ they will be condemned. So not 
everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved
James 2 - Justified by works and not by faith alone
Matthew 19 - Keeping the Commandments (that means all Jewish law and 
whichever Jesus told his followers to obey)
Romans 9 - Predestination, despite the justification by faith
Ephesians 1 - Predestination
Romans 2 - Justified by Works
Revelation 20 - The dead are judged according to their works
Luke 23 - Dying people who repent and accept Jesus can 
be saved before death"


He commented in a discussion on his post:
" Thanks. I already watched American Gospel. It’s a 
nice documentary about what Reformed preachers and churches teach. I 
was still confused and don’t really know what it means to have faith 
in Christ, but I never believed in the “once saved always 
saved” doctrine.

The most negative impact on my faith after 2019 came from 
my experiences with four different destructive cults or high-control groups
, especially Shincheonji and the International Christian Church, 
because the members their were teaching me that 
I must do works and obey to be saved 
and could see that their campus ministries were not healthy 
when they tried to silence me or accused me of 
wanting to fight them when I wanted to 
have a peaceful discussion. They confused me on salvation, but I 
quickly left the ICC ministry known as DREAM when I 
got to the part where they said I must disciple someone to 
become a Christian, and I wish I could leave the Shincheonji ministry 
known at the time I was in it as NorCal 
Missions when I heard the instructor saying that one must 
know and understand the parables to receive salvation. I didn’t 
pay much attention to what they taught until a few months later, but 
I’m glad that I eventually left the group. I definitely experienced 
manipulation, isolation attempts, and willful dishonesty in DREAM 
and NorCal Missions, and came to realize that the NorCal 
Missions recruiter who first invited me to her group 
wasn’t really my friend. "

To which I responded:

"im so sorry that happened to you

Even as i read your account, i feel my blood boiling inside me 
when i read about what these people did to you.

Yes, run far far away from them."

Umm... I was trying to be supportive and empathetic? Not idea pushing?
Excuse me? How is this supposed to be pushy compared to what was 
posted on my facebook post? 

I don't quite understand why this is being used as an example of me being 
rude and pushy, when I commented. I did not even touch on biblical 
inconsistency in my post, did I? Nevermind, I decided to apologise first 
rather than settling this score, and I won't bring it up again, intent is 
to build bridges, not walls. 

Now the biblical inconsistency part is relatively easier to handle.
But it's also a common point of confusion.


Now, onto other issues

1. Personal Religious Trauma experiences
2. Religious Majority Privilege

= Comment 5 (end of conversation) 

"It’s ok. Thanks. We don’t have to discuss about religion 
and spirituality. I hope you’re doing well. Good luck with your studies!"

= Addressing Some Comments

Here's a list of some of the concerns J. Alvarez raised.
Now, I'd be a little more willing to listen if he came to share his 
experiences and perspectives rather than "educate" people, the word 
itself does carry the connotation that "I'm the teacher, you're the 
student", at least that's how I read it. Maybe I misunderstood.

The list is as follows:

1. Personal bad experiences with religious people and groups (x2)
2. Other reasons for not believing the bible is the word of God (vague)
3. Jesus has bad views and teachings besides good ones (need clarity)
4. Jesus was just a man (claim, need clarity)
5. No evidence for Christianity being the one true religion (clarity?)
6. miraculous extraordinary claims have no backing
7. Most religious people can't think for themselves, indoctrination
8. Stifled discussion when he wanted to bring up his views
9. Majority Religious Privilege (x2)
10. Experiences of manipulation
11. LGBTQ issues, forced into suicide or back into the closet
12. forcing women and girls to be submissive to men and boys 
13. bible is full of inaccuracies, contradictions and inconsistencies
14. Schisms (multiple denominations)

== On the Miraculous (point 6)

Okay, there's countless literature on the incredulity of a group of 
eleven men stealing the body or some other explanation, and then being 
allowed to spread religion WITHOUT miraculous signs and wonders. This 
is especially when they were up against the religious and cultural 
elitist group of the Pharisees. And they were up against the military 
might of the Roman Empire. 

Even if they were completely convinced and psychologically delusional to 
the point of death, this does not explain how the Romans were not able 
to quench this "uprising" as they have done so with many similar ones
before.

Of course, I'm biased because I experienced my own personal physical 
healing miracle and have seen the effects of prayer with my own eyes.
But I think it's okay to have one's views shifted because of evidence 
because it's experienced first hand.

== Bad Experiences (point 1) Manipulation (point 10)

Need more elaboration. I've seen abuse of authority, and it is 
heavily condemned in scripture. However, I may not be addressing what 
he's asking.


== Claims of Jesus having Bad Views and Teachings (point 3)

Hmm... I'll need more insight on why he claims Jesus to be bad.


== Claims of Jesus being just a man (point 4)

Well, this point of contention existed from day zero. Plenty of literature 
has been written, I'm not going to really add onto it.

== No evidence for being one true religion (point 5)

Need more clarity. That's a very vague point and claim. Need a thesis,
book or essay reference.




== GroupThink and Indoctrination (point 7)

Unfortunately, I kind of agree with this. It's not a new point I wasn't 
aware of before. I really detest this when people are not allowed to 
ask questions and build trust. Two way conversation is the basic
building block of relationships. And you can't love your neighbour,
and by extension, fulfil the great commission if you can't even learn 
to listen properly.

== Stifled discussion (point 8)

See point 7. The counter point is that it also depends 
on the tone of the conversation.
Often times, the crux of communication is not just the verbal bits, but 
non verbal vits. While legitimate points may be raised, the manner 
in which they are raised will greatly affect the way the conversation
goes. 

I'll be willing to discuss points, but I perceived the tone as rude,
inconsiderate and condescending, therefore I didn't want to respond.

== Majority Religious Privilege (point 9)

TBD

== LGBTQ issues (point 11)

TBD

== Women's Rights (point 12)

TBD

== Biblical Inaccuracy (point 13)

The claim here is one of self contradiction and inaccuracy. 
I will need more insight to grasp this a little better.


== Schisms, multiple denominations and sects (point 14)

"If Christianity were true, why so many divisions over 
interpretation and theology? "

Here's my question in response:

"If the sun is absolutely and truly hot, why do some people on earth 
freeze to death and some people die of heat injury? And why do some 
people experience good crop yields and warmth from that very same sun?"
