= Introduction

We first look at some common criticisms of creationism. One classic
work is done by Pennock @pennock2003creationism . At the time of publishing,
Pennock was at the Lymann Briggs School and Department of Philosophy,
Michigan State University according to the publication. The document
is more of a manifesto laying out strategies for scientists to defend
good science, which is in his work, defined as the theory of evolution.


== Criticism 1: Creationists use Argument from Ignorance

Pennock states that creationists use "argument from ignorance".
Argument from ignorance is a classic logical fallacy where
a person thinks A is true because of the lack of visible
evidence that contradicts A @walton2010arguments . Walton
seems to be an expert in this field and has specialised in these
sorts of logical fallacies. Though he himself has published
literature stating that there are certain cases in which
argument from ignorance is non fallacious @walton1992nonfallacious .
That however, is out of scope for the time being.

In the context of creationism, one argument
which a creationist might fallaciously make is
"we cannot know for sure how the world
came to be, or that we cannot be sure that evolution has produced
the biodiversity that we see today, therefore there must have
been a God who made all the biodiversity". Anecdotally, I may
have heard of some who hold to this view. It's a little cringy, 
though I hold on to the same axiom at the end of the day.
Process is important though, and one ought to take care of how
these thought processes arise. Personally, I don't agree with this
line of reasoning either. 

I might make the assertion or axiom
that things that look "intelligent" should be "intelligently designed"
as an axiom. Axiom 2: I would make the observation that physics from quantum
mechanics to relativity seem to have a certain mathematical beauty
to it. Axiom 3: Mathematical beauty hints at intelligence.
If one presupposes these axiomatically, one can arrive at the 
intelligent design conclusion without the logical fallacy of argument
from ignorance. Lennox, an apologist and mathematician might
agree with these axioms @lennox2009god. 

Though of course, the axioms themselves are not universally agreed
upon. Beauty is subjective and potentially another philosophical 
can of worms altogether. We shall not discuss it yet.

Okay, we'll leave it here for now, there are other matters to explore.
I'll probably come back to this later (TBD).

== Criticism 2: On Irreducible Complexity

Pennock writes that writers such as Behe developed a concept
of irreducible complexity, and how Behe's arguments were refuted
when Biologist Allen Orr showed that a Darwinian mechanisms could
have indeed produced such systems. The paper is titled Darwin v.
Intelligent Design (Again) @orr2005darwin

This was published in the Boston Review, A political and literary
forum as originally cited by Pennock, or in Think Autumn in Cambridge
University Press. Are these peer reviewed? It seems to be more a forum
in the former case or a university
magazine rather than a peer reviewed paper. 

Now in Orr's writing, he essentially quotes that "evolutionists
all know that from the time the earth formed, it took three
billion years to evolve the first true cell but only half
as long to get human beings from this cell". 
@orr2005darwin
The claims here are quite
vague. What is the mechanism and chemistry? Where are the peer
reviews? And how did you come up with three billion years? Where are
your error bars? And what is the mathematical model used
to come up with this timeframe?
I need to see how you came up with those numbers.
Probability in abiogenesis is as much a big black box if you don't
quantify how it happened. Looks like I'll need to search more 
literature here.

Orr writes that while it is highly unlikely that all the parts of
an irreducibly complex system are assembled simultaneously, he
asserts that "Behe's colossal mistake" is that no Darwinian
solution remains. Orr says that an Behe's colossal mistake is
that in rejecting the possibility that irreducibly complex parts
can be evolved one part at a time provided the sub parts of the
reducibly complex system serves some function initially. He gives
the examples that air bladders evolved into lungs. So while
lungs are extremely complex in that having one part fail
would shut the whole thing down, they could have evolved via 
Darwinian mechanism. 
@orr2005darwin
Orr then goes on writing that this scenario is not hypothetical
and he uses the experience of computer programmers.

Programmers may iteratively develop programs and build lines of
code one stage at a time. Each line of code does one job, but
as the programmer makes changes, he or she is able to iteratively
improve the program until the final piece of software does a
more complex job, where all lines of code are needed.
@orr2005darwin

I find it amusing however, that he would use a programming analogy,
given that program development requires many many steps of intelligent
guided design. It is an analogy that serves more to strengthen
the argument of intelligent design rather than weaken it. This
is because an intelligent programmer or designer is already assumed
from the get go in code development. 

I'm writing this repository on Github and have experience with
various programming languages and with writing and using simulation
software. I know how complex things can get. A programmer does NOT
randomly program functions and classes which do random things, and
assmeble them together by chance. A programmer also cannot
do anything without first knowing the syntax of the language. 
This requires intelligence as well, doesn't it? You don't just
randomly type things into the interpreter or compiler and hope
it works. And guess what, interpreters and compilers are also
intelligently designed by other programmers. These then run on
an operating system, such as Windows or Linux. And I know the
Linux Kernel is incredibly complex and designed by highly
intelligent people. And that's only software, we haven't even
discussed design in hardware, as well as the electrical and cooling
systems required to support the hardware.

Moreover, a programmer has some end in mind
they want to achieve. Whether it is Computational Fluid Dynamics 
simulation, or mesh building, or building some artificial neural
network. Given that end goal, the programmer then breaks down
the problem into many parts with the use of Object Oriented Programming
to segregate the required functions and data into various classes
as is the often the case for C++, Java or C\#.
A programmer may also choose to organise the required tasks via
Functional Programming, via Haskell perhaps. Regardless of
the code paradigm, there will be an intelligent programmer planning
how the program runs, 
and how it should function to meet customer needs. There is
more often than not, the presence of well thought out design when
it comes to real world software development and research.
So, in Orr using the programming analogy, I think it is a very poor
choice of analogy in trying to prove his point.

Now, a programming analogy may not carry over directly to biology. 
But it is worth looking at the underlying scientific work behind
the arguments.
Orr quotes H. J. Muller's work in 1918 and 1939 "that genes that
at first improved function will routinely become essential
parts of a pathway. So the gradual evolution of irreducibly complex
systems is not only possible, it's expected" @orr2005darwin. 

=== On Mutations by Herman J Muller

Now, I'll be interested to go down the rabbit hole of H. J. Muller.
This was what I was looking for. Probably come back here and
write more. A good place to start is one of Muller's most well quoted
papers "The relation of recombination to mutational advance"
@muller1964relation . 

Now I'm not quite able to find Muller's original papers. But from
a quick internet search, he was awarded a nobel prize for his work
in inducing genetic mutations with the use of X-rays (ionising 
radiation). I'm not a heatlh physics person, but of course, 
ionising radiation is what I'm meant to know professionally. One
possible candidate for the 1938 paper Orr talks about is Muller's work
on Radium titled "Report on investigation with Radium". 
@muller1939report  I currently am not able to find this
report at the time of writing. So I have very little to go on.

Another report is on 1928, where Muller talks about producing
mutations with X-rays. @muller1928production . Don't
know if this is that relevant, but good to read for background 
anyhow. He basically states that when he blasted X-rays at fruit flies,
and then have then mate with non irradiated fruit flies, the offspring
of these flies (he refers to them as crosses) have a higher mortality
rate than those of the control fruit flies. He refers to the mortalities
as "lethal mutations". It's a little frustrating as I don't see
a methods section here indicating the rate and dose of exposure. 
Such information is meant to be bread and butter for any piece of
scientific literature. This is not the best of quality due to
the lack of materials and methods. But to be fair, hindsight is 20/20,
and he published his papers in the 1920s, so we can't be too harsh on
him. Nevertheless, you can't really repeat experiments here without
those pieces of information.

Presence of such poor quality papers would probably have been higher
in those days. 
But anyhow, let's see his thought process. He has pretty much
established

==== Mutations Require Irreducibly Complex Reproduction Mechanisms to be Expressed

By the way, a thought came to mind, genetic mutation usually
happens when genes are passed down from one generation to the next.
During these times, the genes of the child are a recombined form
of the parent's genes. (I hope I got it right, correct me if I'm 
wrong). For this to happen, sexual reproduction or asexual reproduction
is necessary. For multicelled organisms, the cells must be
able to undergo mitosis as well!
Without this reproduction, the genes will not be
passed down. Even if they are passed within the same generation via
viruses or some other means, the genes will not be passed down if
the organisms, single celled or otherwise, reproduce. Therefore,
the capability to reproduce, sexually or asexually
seems quite essential to the process of evolution. This is because
even if genetic mutation occurs within an organism when it is
alive, the organism will eventually die. If it dies, that genetic
information is lost. I must say that for mutation to occur and
for those genes to be passed down from generation to generation,
the capability for reproduction is a prerequisite. And reproduction,
in any of its forms, could be said to be an irreducibly complex 
mechanism. 

And the fact is that, for mutations to be expressed within the cell,
the prerequisite is that genes must be expressed. For that to happen,
there is also an irreducibly complex process. Today, we see that
as there are complex proteins and enzymes which help this process.
The transcription factors help to transcribe the information
within DNA to mRNA. And the mRNA is meant to go to the ribosome
to be translated into a protein. For any of these processes to happen,
the cell usually needs some source of energy. Adenosine Triphosphate
(ATP). Today, that ATP is produced in the mitochondria. In a supposed
prehistoric cell, perhaps the chemicals were different. However,
the basic functions of genetic transcription must be there. For that
to occur, the cellular machinery and the chemical energy to power
that machinery must be present. Where does the energy come from?
There must be some other system in place to collect this energy
and convert this into energy carrying molecules. All of these
systems are strictly necessary for evolution to even start its
course for mutation over (supposedly) billions of years.

Now perhaps, I'm mistaken and I need to be corrected 
somewhere. So I'll just hold this thought for now and read more 
literature.


=== back to Muller

In muller's 1928 paper
@muller1928production , 
he describes how X-rays cause abberations in
fruit flies (Drosophila) and generalises the mutation effect of
X-rays to other organisms other than fruit flies based on the works
of other researchers. Also, he concludes that radiation from Radium
(which we know today as an alpha and beta emitter), can also cause
mutation. These are perhaps things we take for granted. 

==== a little about Mendelian Genetics

He also mentioned Mendelian genes. What are meneldian genes?
I'll have to look further.
Let's start from the review paper, "the genetic basis of Mendelian
phenotypes: Discoveries, Challenges and Opportunities" 
@chong2015genetic . We'll need to get used 
to some of the jargon used just in the abstract.

1. phenotypes
2. genotypes

Johannsen calls the genotype "sum total of all the genes" in a 
zygote (or embryo) @johannsen1911genotype . Whereas the
phenotype describes the different organisms distinguishable 
by observable characteristics @johannsen1911genotype . 
For example, a human is a different phenotype from a bear. 
From person to person within the same human race, two siblings
will have different phenotypes because they have different
characteristics which are observable. 

Mendelian genetics says that the sum total of all
genes of a living organism 
(genotypes) will cause the different observable characteristics
(phenotypes) between organisms. I guess phenotypes and phenomenon
have a similar root word, in that they refer to observable facts.
So one key idea of Mendelian genetics is that genotype determines 
phenotype. 

Anyhow, Chong et al's paper @chong2015genetic  has its focus
more about mapping the human genome and using that knowledge to treat
disease. It is more focused on clinical advances and understanding
"the genetic basis for inherited disease" @chong2015genetic .
Not much is said here with regards to origin, and genetic disease
is another rabbit hole I cannot explore for now.

More about Mendel, he describes laws of inheritance. One of 
these laws is the law of random assortment @davey2003mendelian . 
Mendel's original paper is called experiments in plant 
hybridisation @mendel1996experiments . This was the paper I was
looking for when I wanted to understand more about Mendel's laws
and experiments.

So, Mendel had this paper about plant hybridisation. The particular 
paper I'm reading pertains to a translated version 
@mendel1996experiments from German, since Gregor Mendel 
was indeed German speaking. Several corrections have been made since
the first translation in 1901 by Baeston @mendel1996experiments . 
I will assume the translations are reasonably accurate and reliable.

It is noteworthy that Mendel did his studies on plants when doing
"plant hybridisation" experiments, or breeding of plant types. 
Mendel highlights in his methods
section that experiments were carefully done to exclude extraneous
(irrelevant) circumstances such as unintended cross pollination from
other plant species. Mendel also notes that cross breeding does
inevitably result in some plants being sterile which can frustrate
experiments. However, he notes that "all members of the series
developed in each successive generations should be, without
exception, subjected to observation". @mendel1996experiments 

The language is difficult to say the least, but my working understanding
is that the plants are all subject to observation regardless of 
the sterility or reduced fertility.

Mendel notes in his experiment that "only the most vigorous plants
were chosen for his fertilisation experiments" as the weaker
plants "afford uncertain results @mendel1996experiments .
By that he means that many of the "weakly" plants fail to flower
or produce inferior seeds @mendel1996experiments .

Mendel uses a large number of plants in his experiments to deduce
the statistical ratio of 3:1. 253 hybrids and 7324 seeds produced
a phenotype of 5474 round or roundish seeds, 1850 angular or wrinkled
seeds. (ratio 2.96:1)
258 plants yielded 8023 seeds of which 6022 were yellow, 
2001 were green. (ratio of 3.01:1). This is quite impressive detective
work, it is very thorough and statistically significant. 
@mendel1996experiments 

From these statistics, he comes up with a mathematical model of sorts
to describe the propagation of these recessive and dominant genes
and their resultant phenotypes. @mendel1996experiments  
The mathematical model rests on the assumption that the way 
reproductive cells recombine to form a new zygote (seed)
is quite probabilistic. 

But yes, reading Mendel's experiments of peas is a little dry. But it 
is a fundamentally useful model to describe inheritance, and quite
impressive for someone in the 1800s to write. It seems he has done
his homework quite well. I'll probably continue another time.



Anyway I shall sleep for now...
