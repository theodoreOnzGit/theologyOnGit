= Introduction

We first look at some common criticisms of creationism. One classic
work is done by Pennock @pennock2003creationism . At the time of publishing,
Pennock was at the Lymann Briggs School and Department of Philosophy,
Michigan State University according to the publication. The document
is more of a manifesto laying out strategies for scientists to defend
good science, which is in his work, defined as the theory of evolution.


== Criticism 1: Creationists use Argument from Ignorance

Pennock states that creationists use "argument from ignorance".
Argument from ignorance is a classic logical fallacy where
a person thinks A is true because of the lack of visible
evidence that contradicts A @walton2010arguments . Walton
seems to be an expert in this field and has specialised in these
sorts of logical fallacies. Though he himself has published
literature stating that there are certain cases in which
argument from ignorance is non fallacious @walton1992nonfallacious .
That however, is out of scope for the time being.

In the context of creationism, one argument
which a creationist might fallaciously make is
"we cannot know for sure how the world
came to be, or that we cannot be sure that evolution has produced
the biodiversity that we see today, therefore there must have
been a God who made all the biodiversity". Anecdotally, I may
have heard of some who hold to this view. It's a little cringy, 
though I hold on to the same axiom at the end of the day.
Process is important though, and one ought to take care of how
these thought processes arise. Personally, I don't agree with this
line of reasoning either. 

I might make the assertion or axiom
that things that look "intelligent" should be "intelligently designed"
as an axiom. Axiom 2: I would make the observation that physics from quantum
mechanics to relativity seem to have a certain mathematical beauty
to it. Axiom 3: Mathematical beauty hints at intelligence.
If one presupposes these axiomatically, one can arrive at the 
intelligent design conclusion without the logical fallacy of argument
from ignorance. Lennox, an apologist and mathematician might
agree with these axioms @lennox2009god. 

Though of course, the axioms themselves are not universally agreed
upon. Beauty is subjective and potentially another philosophical 
can of worms altogether. We shall not discuss it yet.

Okay, we'll leave it here for now, there are other matters to explore.
I'll probably come back to this later (TBD).
