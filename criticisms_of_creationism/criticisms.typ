= Introduction

We first look at some common criticisms of creationism. One classic
work is done by Pennock @pennock2003creationism . At the time of publishing,
Pennock was at the Lymann Briggs School and Department of Philosophy,
Michigan State University according to the publication. The document
is more of a manifesto laying out strategies for scientists to defend
good science, which is in his work, defined as the theory of evolution.


== Criticism 1: Creationists use Argument from Ignorance

Pennock states that creationists use "argument from ignorance".
Argument from ignorance is a classic logical fallacy where
a person thinks A is true because of the lack of visible
evidence that contradicts A @walton2010arguments . Walton
seems to be an expert in this field and has specialised in these
sorts of logical fallacies. Though he himself has published
literature stating that there are certain cases in which
argument from ignorance is non fallacious @walton1992nonfallacious .
That however, is out of scope for the time being.

In the context of creationism, one argument
which a creationist might fallaciously make is
"we cannot know for sure how the world
came to be, or that we cannot be sure that evolution has produced
the biodiversity that we see today, therefore there must have
been a God who made all the biodiversity". Anecdotally, I may
have heard of some who hold to this view. It's a little cringy, 
though I hold on to the same axiom at the end of the day.
Process is important though, and one ought to take care of how
these thought processes arise. Personally, I don't agree with this
line of reasoning either. 

I might make the assertion or axiom
that things that look "intelligent" should be "intelligently designed"
as an axiom. Axiom 2: I would make the observation that physics from quantum
mechanics to relativity seem to have a certain mathematical beauty
to it. Axiom 3: Mathematical beauty hints at intelligence.
If one presupposes these axiomatically, one can arrive at the 
intelligent design conclusion without the logical fallacy of argument
from ignorance. Lennox, an apologist and mathematician might
agree with these axioms @lennox2009god. 

Though of course, the axioms themselves are not universally agreed
upon. Beauty is subjective and potentially another philosophical 
can of worms altogether. We shall not discuss it yet.

Okay, we'll leave it here for now, there are other matters to explore.
I'll probably come back to this later (TBD).

== Criticism 2: On Irreducible Complexity

Pennock writes that writers such as Behe developed a concept
of irreducible complexity, and how Behe's arguments were refuted
when Biologist Allen Orr showed that a Darwinian mechanisms could
have indeed produced such systems. The paper is titled Darwin v.
Intelligent Design (Again) #cite("orr2005darwin").

This was published in the Boston Review, A political and literary
forum as originally cited by Pennock, or in Think Autumn in Cambridge
University Press. Are these peer reviewed? It seems to be more a forum
in the former case or a university
magazine rather than a peer reviewed paper. 

Now in Orr's writing, he essentially quotes that "evolutionists
all know that from the time the earth formed, it took three
billion years to evolve the first true cell but only half
as long to get human beings from this cell". 
#cite("orr2005darwin")
The claims here are quite
vague. What is the mechanism and chemistry? Where are the peer
reviews? And how did you come up with three billion years? Where are
your error bars? And what is the mathematical model used
to come up with this timeframe?
I need to see how you came up with those numbers.
Probability in abiogensis is as much a big black box if you don't
quantify how it happened. Looks like I'll need to search more 
literature here.

Orr writes that while it is highly unlikely that all the parts of
an irreducibly complex system are assembled simultaneously, he
asserts that "Behe's colossal mistake" is that no Darwinian
solution remains. Orr says that an Behe's colossal mistake is
that in rejecting the possibility that irreducibly complex parts
can be evolved one part at a time provided the sub parts of the
reducibly complex system serves some function initially. He gives
the examples that air bladders evolved into lungs. So while
lungs are extremely complex in that having one part fail
would shut the whole thing down, they could have evolved via 
Darwinian mechanism. 
#cite("orr2005darwin")
Orr then goes on writing that this scenario is not hypothetical
and he uses the experience of computer programmers.

Programmers may iteratively develop programs and build lines of
code one stage at a time. Each line of code does one job, but
as the programmer makes changes, he or she is able to iteratively
improve the program until the final piece of software does a
more complex job, where all lines of code are needed.
#cite("orr2005darwin")

I find it amusing however, that he would use a programming analogy,
given that program development requires many many steps of intelligent
guided design. It is an analogy that serves more to strengthen
the argument of intelligent design rather than weaken it. This
is because an intelligent programmer or designer is already assumed
from the get go in code development. 

I'm writing this repository on Github and have experience with
various programming languages and with writing and using simulation
software. I know how complex things can get. A programmer does NOT
randomly program functions and classes which do random things, and
assmeble them together by chance. A programmer also cannot
do anything without first knowing the syntax of the language. 
This requires intelligence as well, doesn't it? You don't just
randomly type things into the interpreter or compiler and hope
it works. And guess what, interpreters and compilers are also
intelligently designed by other programmers. These then run on
an operating system, such as Windows or Linux. And I know the
Linux Kernel is incredibly complex and designed by highly
intelligent people. And that's only software, we haven't even
discussed design in hardware, as well as the electrical and cooling
systems required to support the hardware.

Moreover, a programmer has some end in mind
they want to achieve. Whether it is Computational Fluid Dynamics 
simulation, or mesh building, or building some artificial neural
network. Given that end goal, the programmer then breaks down
the problem into many parts with the use of Object Oriented Programming
to segregate the required functions and data into various classes
as is the often the case for C++, Java or C\#.
A programmer may also choose to organise the required tasks via
Functional Programming, via Haskell perhaps. Regardless of
the code paradigm, there will be an intelligent programmer planning
how the program runs, 
and how it should function to meet customer needs. There is
more often than not, the presence of well thought out design when
it comes to real world software development and research.
So, in Orr using the programming analogy, I think it is a very poor
choice of analogy in trying to prove his point.

Now, a programming analogy may not carry over directly to biology. 
But it is worth looking at the underlying scientific work behind
the arguments.
Orr quotes H. J. Muller's work in 1918 and 1939 "that genes that
at first improved function will routinely become essential
parts of a pathway. So the gradual evolution of irreducibly complex
systems is not only possible, it's expected" #cite("orr2005darwin"). 

Now, I'll be interested to go down the rabbit hole of H. J. Muller.
This was what I was looking for. Probably come back here and
write more. A good place to start is one of Muller's most well quoted
papers "The relation of recombination to mutational advance"
#cite("muller1964relation"). 

To be Continued... I'm taking a break tonight...
