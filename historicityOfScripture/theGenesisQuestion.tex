\part{The Question on Hand}

Genesis often comes up as a matter of debate among christans, scholars and critics. The six day creation account has generated plenty of controversy as to the method of interpretation of Genesis 1-3 and therefore how much of it can be trusted. 

It is the prevailing scientific thought that the universe is billions of years old and the earth is several billion years old. Earth was formed through gradual processes, and life somehow evolved as a matter of a combination of abiogenesis and evolution. Evolution attempts to explain the many forms and types of life present on planet earth while abiogenesis attempts to explain how the first cell was formed.


Such prevailing thoughts seem to contradict the account given in Genesis. Thus generating the said controversy.
